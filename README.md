# useful-dnd-things
eventually, some useful things for D&amp;D 5e

- Bestiary - first view, then auto adjust (change size), then maybe, someday, full editor

- Spell List - just what it sound slike. ya, there are a million of them out there already, so what?

- Spell Book - save specific spells to custom lists (like a characater's spell book) for easy reference at the table

- would be nice if it looks nice on a phone as well as desktop. but since it's running locally, that's a low priority.

requires a web server: if yo python, run python -m SimpleHTTPServer in the repo's root directory
