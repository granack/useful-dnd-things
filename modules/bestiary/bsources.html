      <h2>Sources</h2>
      <p>Each monster has a source listed below the stat box. Only monsters from sources licensed under the <a href="OGLv1.0a.html" target="_blank">Open Game License</a> are included. Tools are available to add monsters to your list (when running on your server), but if you distribute anything you add, you must either be the creator of said content, or have permission to do so. A license is the normal way to provide permission. The Open Gaming Content license seems to allow distribution.</p>
      <p>Note that many monsters have more than one source. They are included here if <em>any</em> listed source is OGC licensed.</p>
      <p>There are a number of sources that you will see, but right now there are two (2) OGC sources being used: SRD and Tome of Beasts.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">System Reference Document (SRD) 5.1</a>: Published by Wizards of the Coast, this is sort of the defining document of Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th edition, but with "Product Identity" content striped out. Therefore, it is NOT Dungeons &amp; Dragons; it is the System Reference Document 5.1.</li>
          <li><a href="https://koboldpress.com/tome-of-beasts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tome of Beasts</a>: Published by Kobold Press. Hundreds playtested monsters for 5th Edition all released in a beuatiful book with amazing artwork under the Open Game Content license (artwork is not OGC).</li>
        </ul>
      <p>There are other sources mentioned. These are not OGC licensed, so there are other monsters in these books not listed here. Generally, if you plan on playing D&amp;D as a player or DM, you should really consider buying them. Check with your local game stores first (support a local business!), but they are available at various online retailers as well if you can't find them locally. They are all published by Wizards of the Coast. I'll divide these into two groups.</p>
      <p>The first group is rules and content. There isn't much a spedcific thing for characters to do. They are about how to play, how to DM, how to create characters, how to place monsters, how to ... Note that everything in the SRD is in one of the 3 books noted as a core book below.
        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Basic Rules</a>: Basic Rules are kind of a subset of the SRD with some of the D&amp;D flavor ("Product Identity") added back in. There are separate player and DM books. They are free downloads from WotC.</li>
          <li><a href="http://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_playershandbook" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Player's Handbook</a>: Get this first as it's the most useful of them all. Every group of players should have at least two or three at the table for everyone to use. Having only this and the SRD can work well for a while, especially if the DM is usng pre-made adventures. This is considered a "core book."</li>
          <li><a href="http://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/dungeon-masters-guide" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>: A must for a DM who wants to create her own game world. Also, a few optional rules not covered by the Player's Handbook. This is considered a "core book."</li>
          <li><a href="http://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/monster-manual" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Monster Manual</a>: A book of many monsters, with descriptions, pictures and stats. A lot of the monsters' stats are in the SRD, but all of them. Also, most monsters in the SRD have no description, but the Monster Manual has a description and picture for them all. This is considered a "core book."</li>
          <li><a href="http://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/volos-guide-to-monsters" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Volo's Guide to Monsters</a>: A book with not as many monsters as the Monster Manual, but it has in-depth discussion about a some types of monsters, some more playable PC races, and some playable moster races. Some good lore if you don't mind spending the money. </li>
          <li>Other: There are other books in this category that include no monsters and won't be listed here.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>The other group is campaigns or adventures. Generally no real new rules, but sometimes new player options, items or monsters. They always provide a pre-made setting, with locations, encounters, and villains. There is nothing in the SRD (or therefore in this Bestiary) that is on one of these books that is not also in one of the core books.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Hoard of the Dragon Queen</li>
          <li>The Rise of Tiamat</li>
          <li>Princes of the Apocolypse</li>
          <li>Out of the Abyss</li>
          <li>Curse of Strahd</li>
          <li>Storm King's Thunder</li>
          <li>Tales fronm the Yawning Portal (This one is a series of 7 unrelated adventures)</li>
          <li>Tomb of Annihilation</li>
        </ul>
      <p><strong>Note</strong>: The SRD can substitute for a base rules reference in place of all or any of the above, but it has limited <em>options</em>. Fewer classes, subclasses, races, spells, monsters.</p>
      <h3>Other stuff?</h3>
      <p>There are like thousands of monsters that people have created. Quality wil vary from terrible to amazing. Most will be in the middle somewhere. The Bestiary incudes tools you can use to import your own selection of monsters. They do need to be in the right type of data format. See the <a href="modules/bestiary/tools/readme.md" target="_blank">Bestiary Tools readme</a> for info. There are example files that I used to build the default list that you can use as a template. If you have OGC licensed monster info in a structured data format (such as delimited text, xml, or json; not just in a PDF or Word document) I may be able to help get it into the correct format. Submit an issue on the github about it.</p>
